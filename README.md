# Moon Hollow 

A simple puzzle game following the unlikely hero trope where a black cat is trying to lift the bad luck (curse) of the city. 
Developed for Entertainment Computing Course at the University of Bremen in the Summer Semester of Academic year 2023/2024.

# Disclaimer
I developed this game on Windows using Unity and aimed for 1920x1080 resolution, or HD.
So the build for Mac might differ.
